## Skills

### Problem solving

Ability to break down problems into small ones and focus on one at a time. An example of this would be when I created a command line app from scratch, as well as applying a testing framework to construct my code.

- Experience : Command line mystery challenge (week 1); mastery-quizzes challenges (week2-3); student directory created from scratch (week4) and Fizzbuzz challenge to be run from irb using the testing framework for production code.
- Achievements : Make a small program that would give the user the ability to run, save, load the file that has all the user input. This was possible using the comma-separated value files standard library from the Ruby programming language.
I have installed and executed Ruby gems to assist my program building and design. I have used the interactive ruby shell extensively, while pairing with members of my cohort to develop programs that interact with users.
Have applied ruby core concepts learnt whilst practicing from the Makers Academy Mastery curriculum.
- Evidence: AlexandraGF (GitHub, CodeWars, CodePen, freecodecamp.org); puzzle games using logic reasoning and problem solving.

### Pairing communication

Pairing over weekly challenges in Ruby (solving real-world and procedural programs) and solving challenges on CodeWars (pairing using the driver/navigator switching technic, writing a clean code, refactor it using DRY, single responsibility principle to construct methods)

Using the GitHub Collaboration, I'v been able to fork, clone, make a repository, presentable READMEs, contribute to your GitHub pushing remotely from my local repository, commit/push/pull/merge/fetch using version control effectively.
